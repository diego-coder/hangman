# 1) Where I was. 

 ## To completely understand this hangman game, you must understand its coding environment. 

  It was written without the aid of anything other than a voluminous number  
  of google searches on fundamental coding concepts, e.g. comparing strings, converting 
  one type of object to another (strings to chars), and inserting strings into other  
  strings. 
  
 ## Using iPad.  
   
  Which displayed my fourth home computer build, a wildly (for its time) power efficient green home PC  
  with no moving parts, through my commercial grade router bought direct from linksys  
  refurbed, an absolute steal with its warranty, quad core processor, and positively stupid (but awesome) 
  amount of RAM. My wife probably doesn’t think of it as a steal :) ...but it was. 
  
 ## Routed with custom DD-WRT firmware using a cloud based free DNS service for pseudo-static IP connection.
 
  With the router reporting local IP updates to the cloud for a continuous, seamless connection from anywhere 
  in the world to a fixed url. This setup was used on prior projects, like an ultra-low energy usage always-on simultaneously head on and Headless, or sometimes solely headless, rasperberry pi 3b for home based NAS (used, for example, for ½ TB of family picture storage, media replay at 1080p (perfectly fine for its time but outgrown with a 4K UHD OLED, enter the Rasp Pi 4 :) run from different flavors of Linux flavored distros, mostly Debian at first and then later a much lighter yet more heavily utilized Arch install.
  
 ## At one point I was running a DDNS sorted inbound reverse proxy nginx server built from cmd line with  
  semi-working split firewall for outbound traffic.  Simply because reasons.      
  
  All from a multi-generation family of jailbroken iOS iPads or iPhones, of course.  Starting with the jailbreak of the iPhone 3, and never, ever using vanilla iOS (which I later found out is simply rebranded, albeit highly optimized, Unix anyway)  
  and tinkering with the Boolean operators of the OS and software packages as I saw fit. 
  This was, and continues to be, an environment with rapid deployment of the latest upgrade to iOS + latest whatever flavor of the current year jailbreak to both my own 
  and my wife’s devices. Some of the older ones I have kept and will be handed down to my son. 
   
  The earlier generations were always from cmd line, because visual frameworks were albeit nice and operable at the time, 
  they tended to be expensive, and annoyingly slower on the earlier iOS hardware, and I liked to work rapidly from anywhere, 
  when I was in the mood.       
  
  Simple stuff, really, but not everyone runs a setup like this, especially those who say iPads can’t be used in an industrious way,  
  or to code. 

# 2) Where I am. 

 ## To get where I am going, I need all of the above.
 
  Why?  

 ## I drove the overnight shift from 8PM tp 6AM. 

  They are all moving parts of an absolutely critical build out if one wants to drive for a full  
  year - 44,000 miles across mostly the city of San Diego in 2018, and 40,000 miles across San Diego in 2017, in a low carbon 
  emission hybrid-hybrid-electric vehicle that charges on a 110V circuit in 6h 50mm... while programming. The iPad Pro first (9.7) and second generation (10.5) I used to code this, my 2nd and 3rd generation of iPads, and the former of which I am typing this from remotely are all now quite suitably powered – for the task.
  
  That type of environment requires the IDE interface to be up and establish a connection quickly, on the road, and quickly - QUICKLY - between rides - displaying a full rendering of the entire IDE with all its cool bells and whistles in quick and navigable form. 

 ## Oh, and there is nothing quite like coding on an iPad from the floor, while playing with your son. Or recombinant on a couch, rather than hunched over a PC. 
  
  It is actually much easier to type short and logical code than fluent and fun readmes from an iPad. 
  
  Being the sole monetary provider for a family of 3 (with a wonderful wife and 15 month old) for years and being on the road,  
  not naturally having cheap access to a fully featured, super powered IDE like Eclipse locally on an iPad was, for me, a question begging to be answered.  

 ## And of course setting that environment is a snap, if you know how to do it, which I do. 

# 3) Where I am going, I can. 

 ## So sure, Git Bash is easy. 

  If you give me a cmd line from any device, I can use it. Sure Git is relatively easy from cmd.     
  
  ### But nothing is funnier than git pushing and pulling while memeing “I heard you like interfaces, so I put a cmd ln on your pc, so I could type linux commands in a windows bash prompt (ls –la over dir for me cause that’s how I learned it, fam) from a virtual visual interface on the road, while typing on an on-screen keyboard on my iOS iPad...
  
  ...which is hot spotted through an old iOS phone I share with my passengers, should they need a connect. I’m still trying to work in my cheap toy Walmart Droid into this system, because (for again) reasons. 
  
  And although there are very ingenious and well-developed git apps for use on the iPad, which I like and use, I found it simpler to streamline for the heavier parts of coding. 
  
  The Eclipse debugger is good, and catches bugs that I do not.  
  
  But it is one of many frameworks, and best for Java.  
  
  ## There are others I want access to for future projects, in different languages that I already know. My private build out is an extensible roadmap for the future.
  
  I learned coding on javascript, moved on to Java, then took a semester on c++ so simply installing the newest framework for the latest toy language I am playing with on an industrial grade framework on PC (or the virtual macOS for Swift development, which I have also installed, on the same trusty 10-year-old PC) for my use case is better than managing a multitude of queasy and expensive so-so apps for remote work for sale in the iOS app store.   
  
  I would rather not wait to run github’s clunky gui.exe for a series of mouse clicks.
  
# 4) What is the whole truth?

## Just that years and years of work went into the typing of this simple code. But, that, like, doesn't tell the whole story, ya know? 

The end, of the beginning.
